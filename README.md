# InkSpire - Sketch to Image with GANs

InkSpire is a web application that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to convert sketches into colored images in real-time. This project combines an interactive frontend canvas with a Flask backend powered by a pre-trained GAN model, providing users with a seamless and dynamic sketch-to-image translation experience.

---

## Features

### **Real-Time Sketch-to-Image Translation**
- Instantly convert sketches into colored images using advanced GAN models.

### **Interactive Canvas**
- Draw directly on the web interface and view results in real-time.

### **Flask Backend**
- Efficiently processes sketches and uses the GAN model for colorization.

### **Model Comparison**
- Visualize and compare outputs from multiple GAN models.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

### **System Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for the frontend)

### **Python Libraries**
To install the required Python libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Frameworks**
- Flask (for backend)
- TensorFlow

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inkspire.git
cd inkspire
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up the Flask Backend
Run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```
This starts the backend server at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### 4. Frontend Setup
The frontend uses an HTML5 canvas for drawing sketches:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Draw sketches on the canvas.
3. View the real-time colorized results generated by the GAN model.

### 5. Running the App
With the Flask server running and the frontend loaded, you can:
- Start drawing on the canvas.
- View the colorized image generated in real-time.

## How It Works

### **Frontend**
- Users draw on an interactive HTML5 canvas.
- JavaScript sends the canvas data to the Flask backend every second.

### **Backend (Flask)**
- Processes the incoming sketches.
- Sends the sketches to the pre-trained GAN model for colorization.

### **GAN Model**
- A pre-trained GAN model generates colored images from sketches.
- Results are sent back to the frontend for display.

## Technologies Used

### **Core Technologies**
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** For sketch-to-image translation.
- **Flask:** Python web framework for the backend.
- **TensorFlow:** For implementing and running the GAN model.
- **HTML5 Canvas:** Interactive drawing area for users.
- **JavaScript:** Handles real-time interaction with the backend.

### **Visualization**
1. **GAN Model Outputs:** Compare outputs from 5 trained GAN models to evaluate performance.
2. **User Interface Preview:** Showcase the dashboard design for user interaction.
